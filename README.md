# SecureChat
Client and server applications written in Java. Public keys are initially shared between client and server. After which all communication is encrypted by the sending party and decrypted by the receiver.

## Installation
To create the JAR file for the client, include the following packets: (1)client, (2)icons, (3)message.<br/>
To create the JAR file for the server, include the following packets: (1)server, (2)icons, (3)message.<br/>
The server application obviously needs to be up and running before any clients can connect.<br/>
Router settings: Remember to allow connections on the port that is selected in the server GUI.
